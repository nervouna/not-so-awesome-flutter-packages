# Not-So-Awesome Flutter Packages

These packages are small utilities I use almost every project. They are not big enough to be a package on their own, but I find them useful enough to share.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these packages are not tested and may not work as expected. Use at your own risk.

## Packages

* [Handy Extensions][1]: A collection of useful extensions.
* [OpenAI Simple Completion][2]: A simple wrapper for OpenAI's GPT API, supports both OpenAi vanilla API and Azure API.
* [SQFlite Date Table][3]: A simple table to store date in SQFlite. Useful for aggregating data by date.
